# Reco Chile — SAE admission-risk simulator

Reco Chile is a bilingual web application that helps families explore school choices in Chile's *Sistema de Admisión Escolar* (SAE). A Next.js wizard (`web/`) presents the results; a FastAPI service (`api.py`) over the Python engine in `sae_app/` computes them.

The app estimates the probability of assignment to each program in a student's wish list, measures the risk of remaining unmatched, tests whether ties between preferences are consequential, and recommends additional programs that can improve the portfolio while remaining similar to the family's revealed preferences.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a research and decision-support tool. It is not an official SAE service, does not reproduce every operational detail of the centralized assignment process, and cannot guarantee an admission outcome.

## Run the app

Two processes: the FastAPI backend and the Next.js frontend. Requires Python 3.10+ and Node 20+ with pnpm.

```bash
# Terminal 1 — API on http://localhost:8000
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn api:app --reload
```

```bash
# Terminal 2 — web app
cd web
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000/es](http://localhost:3000/es).

Alternatively, run both in containers:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Full details — Python version pinning, Windows, Docker specifics — are under [Installation](#installation).

## Main features

- Build and reorder a wish list directly in the interface.
- Search programs by region and school characteristics.
- Use either a strict ranking or preference equivalence classes.
- Compute a deterministic MTB lottery percentile for each school from `SHA-256(RUN/IPE + RBD)`.
- Account for sibling, priority-student, civil-servant, former-student, and already-enrolled priority flags.
- Estimate each program's availability and final assignment probability.
- Estimate the overall chance of assignment and the single most likely outcome.
- Test every strict ordering compatible with the selected equivalence classes, up to a configurable limit.
- Recommend similar programs using revealed preferences, geographic proximity, competition, estimated admission safety, and diversity.
- Geocode an optional Chilean home address and restrict suggestions to a realistic radius.
- Switch between Spanish and English from the interface.
- Present results in progressive, family-facing language; the risk model and the recommendation methodology are documented below.

## Application workflow

1. On the welcome screen, indicate whether the wish list already exists; acknowledge the disclaimer, then enter the student's RUN or IPE.
2. Add programs in the family's genuine order of preference. An optional toggle groups programs whose internal order is undecided so every compatible ordering is tested.
3. Mark every applicable priority for each establishment and analyze the list.
4. Review the estimated chance of assignment and the single most likely program, named with its commune and region.
5. Inspect suggested backup programs, compare the projected chance after appending each one, and add only acceptable options.
6. Verify priorities for newly added programs and rerun the analysis.

The guided program search can filter by:

- region;
- general or technical-vocational track;
- technical-vocational specialty;
- gender composition;
- school day;
- urban or rural location;
- PIE and PACE participation;
- enrollment and monthly fees;
- religious orientation.

## How the risk model works

### 1. MTB lottery rank

For every selected program, the app normalizes the student identifier, concatenates it with the school's RBD, and computes:

```text
SHA-256(normalized RUN/IPE + normalized RBD)
```

The hexadecimal digest is mapped to a percentile. Because the official priority direction is larger-is-better while the model uses zero-as-best, the percentile is reversed and converted into an integer rank within the program-level reference population.

The same student can therefore receive a different deterministic rank at different schools, while repeated simulations with the same RUN/IPE and RBD remain reproducible.

### 2. Priority-adjusted rank

The active priority tier is resolved in this order:

1. sibling;
2. priority student;
3. parent or guardian employed as a civil servant at the school;
4. former student;
5. no priority.

The current implementation retains the priority-student tier only when the calculated lottery rank falls within the program's recorded `priority_student_seats` allocation; otherwise it falls back to the next applicable tier.

The raw percentile is then mapped into the relevant part of the calibrated 2024 priority distribution using the tier's share and cumulative share.

### 3. Program availability

For a program `s`, let:

- `N_s` be its 2024 lottery reference population;
- `T_s` be the number of true applicants in the calibration data;
- `C_s` be its admission capacity;
- `r_e` be the student's priority-adjusted effective rank.

The number of competing true applicants appearing before the student is modeled as:

```text
X ~ Hypergeometric(N_s - 1, T_s - 1, r_e - 1)
```

The probability that the program is available if the student reaches that wish is:

```text
P(program available) = P(X <= C_s - 1)
```

An option marked as already enrolled is treated as certain to be available. A program with no capacity is treated as unavailable.

### 4. Final assignment probabilities

For a strict list with wish-level availability probabilities `a_1, ..., a_k`, the final probability of assignment to wish `i` is:

```text
P(assigned to i) = a_i × product(1 - a_j) for every j < i
```

The estimated unmatched risk is:

```text
P(unmatched) = product(1 - a_i) for i = 1, ..., k
```

The model distinguishes between:

- **Chance if considered:** availability conditional on reaching that wish.
- **Final chance of assignment:** availability after accounting for every higher-ranked wish.

`sae_app/constants.py` also defines soft and hard unmatched-risk thresholds
(`0.4%` and `2.7%`). The API still returns them, but they are presentation
values, not official SAE cutoffs, and the current interface does not surface
them. Estimated outcomes are always ordered by their modeled probability.

## Equivalence classes

Equivalence-class mode allows several programs to share the same preference group. Lower group numbers remain preferred, but programs inside the same group are treated as tied.

The app enumerates every compatible strict order inside the tied groups. If group sizes are `m_1, ..., m_g`, the number of variants is:

```text
m_1! × m_2! × ... × m_g!
```

Availability is computed once per program and reused across permutations. `/simulate` returns an `equivalence_sensitivity` verdict — whether the internal ordering changes the most likely assigned school, only its final probability, or nothing — with the per-order breakdown. (The current interface computes this but does not surface it; it remains part of the API contract.)

Because the same set of programs is used in every variant, the overall unmatched risk is invariant to internal ordering under the current model. Exact enumeration is capped at `10,000` compatible orders by default.

## Recommendation engine

Recommendations are treated as a portfolio-risk problem rather than a simple nearest-school lookup.

The engine first infers a revealed-preference profile from the current wish list. Higher-ranked wishes receive more weight, using `1 / sqrt(rank)`; in equivalence-class mode, the preference-group number is used instead of the reference row order.

Candidates are evaluated on four components:

| Component                  | What it captures                                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Preference similarity      | Track, specialty, gender composition, school day, rurality, PIE, PACE, fees, and religious orientation  |
| Proximity                  | Straight-line distance from the geocoded home address or the weighted centroid of the current wish list |
| Accessibility              | Historical applicants per seat                                                                          |
| Portfolio-risk improvement | The candidate's estimated availability using the student's actual MTB hash for that school              |

Similarity weights adapt to the dominance, coverage, and reliability of each criterion in the current list. Candidates below the configured similarity floor are excluded when the list provides a usable preference signal.

For a candidate appended after the current list:

```text
estimated final chance if appended
    = current unmatched risk × candidate availability
```

This value is also the marginal reduction in unmatched risk under the model. Newly recommended programs are initially evaluated without special priority flags; the family should add the program, mark any real priority, and rerun the full simulation.

The final selection uses Maximal Marginal Relevance to reduce near-duplicate recommendations. Default weights, distance limits, similarity thresholds, and diversity settings are centralized in `sae_app/recommendations.py`.

## Geographic data

Coordinates are resolved through the following cascade:

1. program or school coordinates from the program metadata;
2. commune coordinates from the optional `data/commune_coordinates.csv` file;
3. an approximate regional centroid.

Distances use the haversine formula and therefore represent straight-line distance, not road distance or travel time.

If the user explicitly submits a home address, the app queries OpenStreetMap's Nominatim service, ranks returned locations for address quality, and warns when the result is only street-, city-, or region-level. With a valid home location, recommendations are limited to `100 km` by default.

## Installation

### Python version

The project requires **Python 3.10 or newer**. The FastAPI models use PEP 604
unions (`int | None`), which older interpreters cannot evaluate at runtime.

The required version is declared in `.python-version`, which is read
automatically by pyenv, uv, mise, and asdf. If you use none of those, install a
matching interpreter yourself.

With [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv):

```bash
brew install pyenv                  # macOS; see the pyenv README for other systems
pyenv install 3.12
```

Add pyenv to your shell once, then restart it:

```bash
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
[[ -d $PYENV_ROOT/bin ]] && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init - zsh)"          # use `bash` instead of `zsh` for bash
```

Inside the project directory, `python` then resolves to the version pinned in
`.python-version`.

### Project setup

Clone the repository and enter the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AugustinPlantureux/Reco-Chile.git
cd Reco-Chile
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows PowerShell, activate it with:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Verify the interpreter before installing, especially on macOS, where a bare
`python3` often resolves to the system Python 3.9:

```bash
python -V                           # expect 3.12.x
```

Install the dependencies and start the API:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn api:app --reload     # http://localhost:8000
```

The main dependencies are FastAPI, pandas, NumPy, and SciPy. The API is only
half the application — start the frontend below as well.

> [!NOTE]
> `requirements.txt` uses lower-bound (`>=`) pins, so a fresh install resolves to
> the newest compatible releases and two environments created at different times
> may differ. Pin exact versions with `pip freeze > requirements.txt` when you
> need a reproducible environment for analysis.

### Frontend (`web/`)

The Next.js wizard is the application's interface. It computes nothing itself:
every number comes from the `sae_app/` engine, served by the FastAPI adapter
`api.py`.

Requirements: **Node ≥ 20 LTS** (the major used for development is in
`web/.nvmrc`) and **pnpm**, whose version is pinned in `web/package.json`
(`packageManager`); `corepack enable` installs exactly that one.

Two processes, in two terminals — the API above, and:

```bash
cd web
pnpm install
pnpm dev                                         # http://localhost:3000/es
```

The browser only ever talks to the Next.js origin: `web/app/api/[...path]/`
proxies to `API_BASE_URL` (default `http://localhost:8000`) server-side, so the
Python port never has to be published and there is no CORS to configure.

See [`web/README.md`](web/README.md) for the frontend's own commands (tests,
Playwright, regenerating the typed API client).

## Run with Docker

Two containers — the FastAPI service and the Next.js server — described by
`docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
docker compose up --build       # http://localhost:3000/es
docker compose down
```

- `Dockerfile.api` (`python:3.12-slim`) installs `requirements.txt`, copies
  `api.py`, `sae_app/` and `data/`, and runs `uvicorn` with **one worker**: the
  Nominatim throttle and the per-IP geocode limit are per process, so a second
  worker would double the outbound request rate.
- `web/Dockerfile` builds the frontend in three stages and ships Next.js'
  standalone output, started with `node server.js` on port 3000 with
  `API_BASE_URL=http://api:8000`.
- Only the web service publishes a port; the API is reachable inside the compose
  network only.
- `TRUST_PROXY` (web) and `SAE_TRUSTED_PROXIES` (api) stay unset in this setup,
  so no `X-Forwarded-For` header is believed and the per-IP geocoding budget
  becomes one shared bucket. That is stricter than per browser, never looser;
  set both only behind a reverse proxy that rewrites the header itself.

Continuous integration runs the same checks — `pytest`, an engine
import-isolation check, `pnpm lint`/`format:check`/`tsc`/`test`/`build`, and
Playwright — in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## Data files

The application expects a `data/` directory next to `api.py`.

### Required files

| `commune_coordinates.csv` | `commune`, optional `region`, latitude (`latitude`, `lat`, or `latitud`), longitude (`longitude`, `lon`, `lng`, or `longitud`) | Improves distance estimates when program-level coordinates are unavailable |

At startup, the app checks required columns, core numeric fields, positive lottery populations, and the internal consistency of cumulative priority shares. Programs with mean-imputed 2024 calibration values remain usable but are flagged as less reliable.

```

`api.py` intentionally contains only HTTP adaptation. Calculation logic lives in the focused modules under `sae_app/`, which has no UI dependency of any kind — the frontend in `web/` formats and explains, and never computes a number.

## Privacy and external services

When the app is run locally:

- RUN/IPE normalization, hashing, wish-list processing, and risk calculations occur on the local machine;
- the student identifier and wish list are not intentionally sent to an external API;
- a home address is sent to OpenStreetMap's Nominatim service only after the user clicks the geocoding button.

If the app is deployed on a remote server, inputs are necessarily processed by that server instance. Deployment operators are responsible for access control, logging, retention, and compliance with applicable privacy requirements. Multi-worker deployments should also use shared Nominatim throttling or a dedicated geocoding service.

## Model limitations

- Results are estimates based on historical calibration data and encoded assumptions, not official admission probabilities.
- Changes in demand, capacities, priorities, or SAE rules can make past calibration less predictive.
- The current priority-student treatment and warning thresholds are explicit modeling choices.
- The final-list calculation combines wish-level availability estimates according to the model implemented in `mtb_engine.py`.
- Imputed calibration values are less reliable than directly observed values.
- Geographic distances are approximate and do not represent routes, travel times, mountain crossings, or public-transport accessibility.
- A geocoder can return an approximate or incorrect location; users should read the precision warning shown by the app.
- Recommendations optimize the encoded score and should be treated as options to investigate, not automatic choices.

For research, auditing, or policy use, review the current data sources, calibration assumptions, and model code before interpreting the outputs.
